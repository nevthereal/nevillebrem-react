# Neville Brem Personal Website

This is the official Repo of https://nevillebrem.com!
It was the first time I used [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) in a Project, so be kind and if you have any suggestions or comments, send them to [my Contact Mail](contact@nevillebrem.com).

I used some Libraries, to which I want to point out:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the styling of the page
- [React Typed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typed) for the typo animations in the hero section
- [EmailJS](https://emailjs.com) for the contact form component
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the beatiful icons
