# Portfolio

## About this repository
This is the official Repo of https://nevillebrem.com!
It is the second version of my old [Portfolio](https://old.nevillebrem.com) ([Github](https://github.com/nevthereal/porfolio-old)). I wanted to use React, since I freshly learned it back then. Now, May 2023, I implemented Vite and used some other Libraries listed below!

## Technologies used:
- Vite (React+JSX)
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- react-intersection-observer
- typed.js
- EmailJS
- Font Awesome
